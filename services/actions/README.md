# Midspace: Actions Service

Express server designed to run on Heroku and serve action calls from Hasura.
Eventually this may be split into multiple microservices.

## Pre-requisites

1. **Full Setup**: Follow the AWS setup instructions in
   [aws/README.md](../../aws/README.md) if you haven't already.
1. **Full Setup**: A SendGrid account per instructions in the main README.
1. A fully configured [Vonage Video API](../../docs/video-service-setup.md) project.
1. [Hasura](../../hasura/README.md) running locally.
1. **Production**: If you will be uploading recorded videos to YouTube, you will
   need a Google Cloud account.
1. **Production**: [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)

## Setting Up Actions Service Local Working Copy

1. `cd services/actions`
1. `cp .env.example .env`
1. Configure your `.env` according to the [Actions Service Configuration](#actions-service-configuration) table below
   - **Quick setup**: Set all the environment variables related to AWS to `XXXX`. BCP: This will not actually work right now, but let's give it a try this way and see how much further we can get.
   - **Full Setup**: You will need the outputs from running the AWS CDK deployment. `ChimeActionsUserAccessKeyId`, `ChimeActionsUserSecretAccessKey`, and `ChimeNotificationsTopic` are found in the `Outputs` tab for the `<prefix>-chime` stack that was deployed in `us-east-1 (N. Virginia)`, and most of the rest of the `AWS_...` environment variable values come from the `Outputs` for the `<prefix>-main` stack deployed to the default region.

Now return to the main README.

## Production: Creating a Google Cloud project

If you or your users will be uploading recorded videos to YouTube, you will need
a Google Cloud project to provide access to the YouTube Data API with OAuth2.

1. Create a new project in [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/).
1. Enable the [YouTube Data API v3](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/youtube.googleapis.com)
1. Create a new [OAuth 2.0 Client ID](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
1. Set the _Authorised JavaScript origins_ `URIs` to the URI at which the frontend is hosted.
1. Set _Authorised redirect URIs_ `URIs` to the `<frontend uri>/googleoauth`.

## Local Development

See root ReadMe instructions for local development for which tasks to run.

If the environment configuration changes, or for example, the `package.json`
commands change, then you will need to restart tasks for this microservice.

## Testing

We use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started) and
[SuperTest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest). SuperTest provides an easy
way to test the express server functions.

## Remote Deployment

Heroku apps are linked to the repo and pull from the branches listed below.

| Branch  | Heroku App |
| ------- | ---------- |
| develop | ci-testing |
| staging | staging    |
| main    | production |

Heroku deployment is a little tricky because this is a monorepo.

- A single heroku app will have multiple containers, one or more for each
  microservice. The root `Procfile` is what Heroku uses to identify what
  services to start and thus which scripts to run.
- The `heroku-postbuild` script in the root `package.json` overrides Heroku Node
  Buildpack's default build task so that we can build each micro-service
  independently.
- The `postinstall` script in the root `package.json` not only makes development
  installs easier, but is essential for Heroku to successfully install and
  manage packages in the root and all micro-services.

## Notes

- The `Procfile` is used by Heroku to start this service. It exists in the
  `clowdr` root directory points at the compiled `build/server.js`.

## Heroku App Configuration

Connect to Github for auto-deployment of a branch. Configure environment
variables according to [the table below](#actions-service-configuration).
